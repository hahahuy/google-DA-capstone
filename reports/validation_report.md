# Data Validation Report

## Summary
This report details the quality checks performed on the Fitbit dataset. While most checks passed successfully,
there are some data quality issues that should be considered when interpreting the analysis results.

## Daily Activity Data
- no_missing_values: FAIL
  * Some records contain missing values that were excluded from analysis
  * This affects less than 5% of the total records
- valid_date_range: PASS
  * All data falls within the expected one-month period
- valid_steps: PASS
  * All step counts are non-negative
- valid_distance: PASS
  * All distance measurements are non-negative
- valid_calories: PASS
  * All calorie measurements are positive
- valid_minutes: PASS
  * All activity minutes are non-negative
- valid_total_minutes: PASS
  * Daily total minutes do not exceed 24 hours

## Sleep Data
- no_missing_values: PASS
  * All required fields are present
- valid_sleep_duration: FAIL
  * Some records show unusually long sleep durations
  * These outliers were filtered out during analysis
- valid_time_in_bed: PASS
  * Time in bed is always greater than or equal to sleep time

## Heart Rate Data
- no_missing_values: PASS
  * All heart rate measurements are complete
- valid_heart_rate: PASS
  * All values fall within normal range (40-220 bpm)
- valid_timestamps: PASS
  * All timestamps are properly formatted

## Weight Data
- valid_weight: PASS
  * All weights fall within reasonable range (20-300 kg)
- valid_bmi: PASS
  * All BMI values are within normal range (15-50)
- no_missing_required: PASS
  * All required fields (Id, Date, Weight, BMI) are present

## Hourly Data
All hourly datasets passed validation checks:
- calories: PASS
  * All calorie measurements are valid
- steps: PASS
  * All step counts are non-negative
- intensities: PASS
  * All intensity measurements are within valid range

## Impact on Analysis
The data quality issues identified (missing values in daily activity and some outliers in sleep duration)
were handled appropriately during the analysis:
1. Records with missing values were excluded
2. Outliers were identified and filtered
3. Remaining data provides a reliable basis for analysis

## Recommendations for Future Data Collection
1. Implement stricter data validation at collection time
2. Add data quality checks for sensor readings
3. Consider collecting additional metadata for context
